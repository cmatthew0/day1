<h2 id="Kipling"> Poem by Kipling </h2>
<blockquote> 
I keep 6 honest serving men <br>
They tought me all I knew <br>
Their names are what, where, and when <br>
And how, and why, and who <br><br>
I send them over land and sea <br>
I send them east and west<br>
and after they have worked for me<br>
I give them all a rest<br>
